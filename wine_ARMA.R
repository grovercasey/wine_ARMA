#Running through an ARMA model using Sonoma County Wine data 
#It  is of cases sales and total revenue generated over a period 
#of about six years â€“ specifically from December 18th, 2004 to April 2nd, 2011.

#The goal is to examine the relationship between total cases sold and various other 
#factors including seasonal variations, real income, and population changes. 
#The income and population metrics were obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data. 
#The real income variable was generated using personal consumption expenditures related 
#directly to food, and a consumer price index with a base year of 2015.
